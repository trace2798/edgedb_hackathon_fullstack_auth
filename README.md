# Productivus: Efficiently manage your task 

### This repo is for my submission for the EdgeDB hackathon which took place during April 26 â€” May 26, 2024

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

**Node.js 18.17 or later.
**macOS, Windows (including WSL), and Linux are supported.
**EdgeDB CLI (It is preferred that you have it already setup, but below I am writing the instruction on how to install below. Refer to the link mentioned if you are having difficulties.)

### Install EdgeDB CLI

## Linux and Mac
```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.edgedb.com | sh
```

## Windows Powershell
```sh
iwr https://ps1.edgedb.com -useb | iex
```

For more installation options, see the [EdgeDB installation guide](https://docs.edgedb.com/cli).


### To directly clone the repo

```shell
git clone https://github.com/trace2798/edgedb_hackathon_fullstack_auth.git
```

### Install packages

```shell
npm i
```

### Setup .env file

```js
UPLOADTHING_SECRET=
UPLOADTHING_APP_ID=
```

### Initiating EdgeDB

```sh
edgedb project init
```
After running that command it will ask you to specify the name of the instance with a default value. You can just press Enter and use the default value.

Then it should ask you to specify the branch name with default as main. Keep it that way.

Then run 
```sh
edgedb ui 
```
I should open up the EdgeDB GUI. Then click on main --> Data viewer. Then you should see the tables which has been defined on the schema

### Setting up Authetication
For this application I have used EdgeDB auth with the Github provider. For that you can follow the guide mentioned on their official website. [EdgeDB Auth Guide](https://docs.edgedb.com/guides/auth)

I have used the GUI to set the auth for my application. I have taken the following steps:
1. Click on auth admin icon on the left sidebar. It is the 6th option. A screen like below should appear

2. Fill it up with your desired name and I did keep the allowed_redirect_urls field empty.
3. Cick on Providers --> Add Provider. For this application I have used Github. Fill in with your Client ID and Secret. I kept my additional scope blank.
4. To get the Github ID and Secret do the following 
Go to your github account --> settings --> Developer settings --> Oauth Apps. Then create a new app by clicking on "New OAuth App"
5. On github both the Homepage URL and Authorized Callback URL has been set to http://localhost:3000/

### Start the app

```shell
npm run dev
```

## Available commands

Running commands with npm `npm run [command]`
